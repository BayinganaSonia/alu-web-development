# 📄 HTML Webpage from Figma Design

Welcome to my first HTML structure-only project!  
This project is based on a Figma design file and focuses **purely on HTML semantic structure** — no CSS, no JavaScript, just clean and organized markup.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- Recreate a webpage layout based on a Figma design.
- Use **semantic HTML5 tags** to structure the content meaningfully.
- Avoid any styling or positioning (no CSS or Flexbox).
- Build a solid foundation for future styling and interaction.

## 🖼️ Figma Design

The design reference for this project is available on Figma:

🔗 [Duplicate to Your Drafts in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/your-figma-link)  
*(Replace with the actual Figma URL given to you.)*

To explore all design elements:
- Create a Figma account (if you haven’t).
- Duplicate the design to your drafts.
- Use the **Inspect** tab to view spacing, structure, and font sizes.

## 🛠️ Structure Overview

The project uses semantic tags such as:

- `<header>` for navigation
- `<main>` as the main container
- `<section>`, `<article>` for content blocks
- `<aside>` for supporting content
- `<footer>` for page footer
- `<nav>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<a>` for menu structure
- `<img>`, `<figure>`, `<figcaption>` for media

## 📌 Notes

- **Fonts**: If your system lacks fonts used in the design, download:
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
  - *Spin-Cycle-OT* (if applicable)
- **Float values**: Feel free to round float values from Figma (e.g. 27.8px → 28px)
- **Validation**: Use [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure HTML correctness
