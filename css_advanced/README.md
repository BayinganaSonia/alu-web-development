# 🎨 CSS Advanced Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is the second phase following the **HTML, Advanced** module. After structuring our webpage using semantic HTML, the focus here shifts to **CSS styling**, where we bring the visual design to life using stylesheets and layout techniques—particularly **CSS Flexbox**—to match the provided **Figma design** precisely.
